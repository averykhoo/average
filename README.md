# An Averaging Library

Unnecessarily many ways to get an average of a bunch of numbers

## todo

* decorators
  * single elem list -> just return the elem
  * zero elem list -> create new exception
  * list of all the same elem -> just return the elem
* docs
  * ordering of means via generalized mean, lehmer mean, stolarsky mean
  * use a table with the dim in a column
* code
  * stolarsky mean + divided differences (more than 2 variables)
